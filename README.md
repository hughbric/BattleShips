# Battle Ships

Go head-to-head against the computer by entering in XY coordinates to sink their ships - and hope yours survive the retaliation.

### How to use

- Clone this repository.
- Open the repository in a text editor - I'm using IntelliJ IDEA at the moment.
- Execute the class with the `main` method inside it, which would be `src/main/java/BattleShips.java`
- Gradle should build and execute the class for you. This also assumes that you have a JDK installed.

### Testing

- This app is tested using JUnit.
- You can find and run the tests in the `src/test/java` folder.

### Approach
The point of this application was to experiment with Java. I focused, initially, on how to go about test driving the application and followed that up with an exploration of inheritance. This naturally led to considerations about encapsulation.
